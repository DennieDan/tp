##### Notes about the command format


* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [owe/OWED_AMOUNT]` can be used as `n/John Doe owe/100.00` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* No two students can have both same **NAME** and **PHONE_NUMBER**, but different students may share a **PHONE_NUMBER** number.

> Reason: Siblings can use a parent's phone number as their **PHONE_NUMBER**. 

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `remind`, `income`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<br> i.e. The `find` command will not be affected by the previous `find` command. 
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `alex` will match `Alex`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `alex` will not match `Alexander`

    * names matches at least one of the keywords **AND** 
    * the tuition day matches the days.
    * e.g. `find n/Alex d/Friday` returns `Alex Tan` because:

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, UGTeach will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the application to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous UGTeach home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
